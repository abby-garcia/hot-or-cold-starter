// // When the page loads, JavaScript should start a new game. Since you'll need to be able to start a new game when the user clicks the "New Game" button, you'll want to create a newGame function that does everything necessary to start a new game.

function newGame(){
	//generate new number
	// restart counter
	//clear out feedback
	//clear out <li> with guess
	//

}



// // When a new game starts, a secret number between 1 and 100 should be generated that the user will have to guess. You should write a named function that takes care of this. You should try to start a new game without refreshing or reloading the page.

// // The user should get feedback about each guess â€“ if it was too low, too high, or just right. This means that you'll need to write a named function that takes a user guess and determines which feedback to provide.

// The game should also supply users with a list of the numbers they have guessed so far. The CSS for this game is set up in such a way that you can simply add each guessed number as an <li> to ul#guessList.







// You'll need to ensure that users provide valid inputs. Note that the guess text input field has the HTML 5 required flag set, so you won't have to worry about blank guesses being submitted (if the user submits a blank guess, they'll be prompted to supply an input). However, you will need to write code that ensures that the user has supplied a numeric input between 1 and 100.

function validation(num){ // what is the paramenter for this? i'll say "num" for now
	if(num === NaN){
		prompt("Please Provide a Number");
	}
	else(num < 1 || num > 100){
		prompt("Please Provide a Number Between 1 and 100.")
	}
}







// The starter template already contains a button in the upper right hand corner for starting a new game, however, this button does not currently do anything. You'll need to write code that allows users to start a new game without making additional calls to the server. Clicking "New Game" should trigger the JavaScript function that starts a new game.

$('.new').click(function(){
	newGame();
});
